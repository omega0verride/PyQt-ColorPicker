# PyQt-ColorPicker
Circular Color Picker for PyQt.

This is a new design for PyQt ColorPicker.

![](/demo/colorpicker_run.PNG)

The color circle is a simple image. The hue values are generated by finding the tangent of the distance of the mouse coordinates + center coordinates within the colorpicker widget.


Make sure that all the files are  in the same directory with the executable/script or change the "working_directory" variable.

If you change the width the pointer might be a bit off, this can be fixed by setting ```pointer_distance_correction```.

Simple example that prints the HSV code:
```python
import sys

from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication

from QtColorPicker import QtColorPicker

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
QtColorPicker(listener=lambda h, s, v: print(f"color: ({h}, {s}, {v})")).show()
sys.exit(app.exec())
```
		
Notice - If you use this as a widget set object names for QPushButtons and QSliders of parent because it affects the child widget.
